        <p><em>Co-founder of <strong><a href="https://airtutors.org/">Air Tutors</a></strong></em></p>
        <p>I'm proud to be a Founding Member of Air Tutors (www.airtutors.org), a community of inspirational mentor-minded educators, counselors, and educational therapists helping students, families, and fellow teachers succeed through an amazing
          educational experience.

          After teaching high school math for fifteen years to a wide array of students--from those that struggled with Algebra 1 to those that breezed through AP Calculus--I saw the desperate need for more one-on-one interaction with students as
          they were
          easily lost in large class sizes. Air Tutors benefits students of all levels and learning styles, allowing them to receive individualized instruction--remotely--from personable, Ivy League caliber tutors at any time of day.

          Our goal is for all students, regardless of background or geography, to gain confidence through comprehension via the Air Tutors experience.</p>
